Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables 
of a relational database to minimize data redundancy.Normalization involves 
decomposing a table into less redundant (and smaller) tables but without 
losing information; defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the 
primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data so that additions,
 deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and 
then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.
