1.Normalized tables are usually smaller and have a smaller foot-print because the data is 
divided vertically among many tables. This allows them to perform better as they are small 
enough to get fit into the buffer.
2.The updates are very fast because the data to be updated is located at a single place and 
there are no duplicates.
3.Similarly the inserts are very fast because the data has to be inserted at a single place 
and does not have to be duplicated.
4.The selects are fast in cases where data has to be fetched from a single table, because 
normally normalized tables are small enough to get fit into the buffer.Because the data is 
not duplicated so there is less need for heavy duty group by or distinct queries.
