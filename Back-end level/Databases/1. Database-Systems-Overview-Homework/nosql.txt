Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling, 
and finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL 
(e.g. key-value, graph, or document) differ from those used in relational databases, 
making some operations faster in NoSQL and others faster in relational databases. 
The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve.
