Integrity constraints are used to ensure accuracy and consistency of data in a relational database. 
Data integrity is handled in a relational database through the concept of referential integrity. 
Many types of integrity constraints play a role in referential integrity.

Primary Key Constraints
Primary key is the term used to identify one or more columns in a table that make a row of data unique.

Unique Constraints
A unique column constraint in a table is similar to a primary key in that the value in that column for 
every row of data in the table must have a unique value.


Foreign Key Constraints
A foreign key is a column in a child table that references a primary key in the parent table. 
A foreign key constraint is the main mechanism used to enforce referential integrity between
 tables in a relational database. 

NOT NULL Constraints
Previous examples use the keywords NULL and NOT NULL listed on the same line as each column 
and after the data type. NOT NULL is a constraint that you can place on a table's column. 
This constraint disallows the entrance of NULL values into a column; in other words, data is
required in a NOT NULL column for each row of data in the table.
