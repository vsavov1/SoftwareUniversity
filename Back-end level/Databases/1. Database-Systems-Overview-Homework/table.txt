1.A table is a data structure used to organize information, just as it is on paper.

2.Well, first each database table is given a unique name. Without a unique name the 
DBMS (DataBase Management System) would get very confused.Next, each column in the 
table is given a unique name. This doesn't mean each column that you
name has to be unique within the entire database. It only has to be unique within 
the table you have created.The next thing to understand about your table is the 
Primary Key. The Primary Key simply refers to a column in your table that is
guaranteed unique. The Primary Key is then used for the purposes of indexing your 
table which makes it much more efficient to search, sort, link, etc.The difrences
is table is place where is stored date, realations is connection between data.
