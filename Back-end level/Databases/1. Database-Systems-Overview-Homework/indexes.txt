1.unique index to help locate information.
2.Non-clustered, clustered, cluster.
3.Clustering alters the data block into a certain distinct order to match the index, 
resulting in the row data being stored in order. Therefore, only one clustered index can
be created on a given database table. Clustered indices can greatly increase overall 
speed of retrieval, but usually only where the data is accessed sequentially in the same 
or reverse order of the clustered index, or when a range of items is selected.
4.B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential
access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
5.A columnstore index is a technology for storing, retrieving and managing data by using
a columnar data format, called a columnstore.
6.In text retrieval, full text search refers to techniques for searching a single 
computer-stored document or a collection in a full text database.
7.You can use a spatial index for indexing geo-objects - shapes. The spatial index makes 
it possible to efficiently search for objects that overlap in space.
8.Advantages: use an index for quick access to a database table specific information.
The index is a structure of the database table the value of one or more columns to sort.
Disadvantages: too index will affect the speed of update and insert, because it requires 
the same update each index file.
