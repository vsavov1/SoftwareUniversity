A relational DBMS is special system software that is used to manage the organization,
 storage, access, security and integrity of data.  This specialized software allows 
application systems to focus on the user interface, data validation and screen navigation.  
When there is a need to add, modify, delete or display data, the application system simply 
makes a "call" to the RDBMS.
